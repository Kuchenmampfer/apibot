## Why Choose Python <a name="1"></a>
Python has been the top 5 language for the last few years because of it's ease of use and dedicated community. With a 
language backed by a strong community you can expect a ton of documentation on the language and the various libraries
created for the language. 

## Learning Python Resources <a name="2"></a>
There is a ton of resources for Python considering how much traction it has lately. A book that we highly recommend
is the [Python Crash Course](https://www.amazon.com/Python-Crash-Course-Hands-Project-Based/dp/1593276036). This book
will get you started writing little projects to get you comfortable with the language. It is important when learning 
a news language, to spend time building up your skills. It will not benefit you to learn a new language AND learn 
several APIs like discord.py and coc.py. 

An additional resource for learning python that is free is using youtube. Some of our favorite YouTube teachers include:
- [Python Tutorial - Python for Beginners [Full Course]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uQrJ0TkZlc&t=90s)
- [Python Programming](https://pythonprogramming.net)
